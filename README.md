# The analysis-of-teenage-pregnancy-and-its-prevention-in-Nigeria
## Introduction
Young people between the ages of 15 and 24 account for 1.2 billion of the world's population. The majority live in Sub-Saharan Africa, where they are vulnerable to adolescent pregnancies and HIV infection. Unwanted pregnancies and HIV infection continue to be frightening issues for young people, with studies indicating that HIV-positive youth experience the most difficulties. In recent years, there has been a lot of focus on preventing teenage pregnancy, which has resulted in various campaigns. This is because it is seen as a bad phenomena in modern times due to the detrimental impact on the health of these young teenagers. Despite the implementation of national adolescent pregnancy programs and tactics, global teen birth rates have risen.
Pregnancy among teenagers may play a role.There are significant costs associated with women's health and infant mortality, in addition to the lost potential of girls who are married off. The teenage pregnant girl is subjected to torture, abuse, and the threat of contracting HIV/AIDS. Some young girls are compelled to marry at a young age. Others are simply too young to make an educated choice regarding their marriage partner or the marriage's repercussions. Early marriage robs a girl of her adolescence. Teenagers under the age of 15 are five times more likely than women in their thirties to die during pregnancy or childbirth, and infant mortality rates are also greater. Recent research has revealed that relationships between young men and women are mostly based on gender.
A large body of evidence from randomized, controlled trials shows that interventions focused on certain features can be effective in lowering and avoiding sexual risk behaviors, such as unplanned pregnancy, among teenagers. However, available data show that the intervention effects of such campaigns fade over time, and there is a scarcity of information about long-term prevention effects and factors that may sustain such effects, particularly among preadolescents and adolescents as they mature and face changing personal and social environments. Several societal factors have been recognized as contributing to early pregnancy and marriage, including religious views, inactivity, and economic circumstances.
## Statement of the problem
