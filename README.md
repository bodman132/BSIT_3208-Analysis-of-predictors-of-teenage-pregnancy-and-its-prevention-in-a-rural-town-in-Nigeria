## Introduction
Globally, young people aged between 15 and 24 years make up 1.2 billion of the world's population. The majority live in Sub-Saharan Africa and are vulnerable to teenage pregnancies and HIV infection Unwanted pregnancies and HIV infection continue to be daunting problems for young people, and studies indicate that HIV-infected youth face the greatest dilemmas . Great attentions have been given to prevention of teenage pregnancy in recent times leading to several campaigns to prevent teenage pregnancy .This is because it has been viewed as a negative phenomenon in modern times because of the attending negative effect on the health of these young teenagers. Despite the establishment of national teenage pregnancy programmes and strategies, teenage birth rates have increased globally 
Teenage pregnancy might contribute to the cycle of poverty WHO . In addition to the lost potentials of girls who are married off, there are real cost associated with women's health and infant mortality. The teenage pregnant girl is exposed to torture, abuse, and the risk of the deadly HIV/AIDS infection. Some young girls are forced into marriage at a very early age. Others are simply too young to make an informed decision about their marriage partner or about the implications of the marriage itself. Early marriage deprives a girl of her adolescence Teenagers younger than 15 are five times more likely to die during pregnancy or childbirth than women in their twenties and mortality rates for their infants are higher as well. Recent studies have shown that associations among young men and women are largely explained by socioeconomic confounding .
A vast literature describing randomized, controlled trials clearly demonstrates that interventions with attention to specific elements can be successful in reducing and preventing sexual risk behaviours including unwanted pregnancy among teenagers . However, available data indicate that intervention effects from such campaign wane over time, there is a paucity of information regarding long-term effects from prevention efforts and factors that may sustain such effects, particularly among preadolescents and adolescents as they mature and face changing personal and social environments . Several social factors such as religious beliefs, idleness and economic factors have been identified as factors contributing to early pregnancy and marriage.
## Statement of the problem

This study was therefore designed to determine the recent prevalence and identify factors associated with teenage pregnancy in a semi rural area in Nigeria. This has implications in the development of policies that will reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancy and give equal access to essential facilities which subsequently improve the health of the adolescents in low income countries such as Nigeria.


This   study seek to answer the following questions:

- Why many teenagers engage in early pregnancy?
- What are the effects of early pregnancy for the health of teenager who are involved?
- Why teenagers are suffering early pregnancy?
- What ages are usually involved in early pregnancy?
- Why teenagers are sexually active?
- What are the prevention of early pregnancy?
## Significance of the study
The proposed project overall goal is to provide  what are the government solutions of engaging early pregnancy,  what ages most number of early pregnancy, the causes and effects and the number of ages who engaged sexual intercourse. 
Having this kind of data sets have it's own advantage,

- To determine the total population of teenage pregnancy.
- Knowing the causes why teenager engage sexual activities.
- To have an better understanding what would be effects of early pregnancy.
- To stop promoting early pregnancy

This study will be beneficial to : 
Student Mothers. They could gain insight about their situation and be aware of their responsibilities as both parent and student.

To teenagers are the one that are affected on this research. Maybe this research can help them to know what are they will gonna do if this topic will also comes to their self. Also they can know the effects of this case and the disadvantages for them. 
## Methods
This was an analytical cross-sectional study that quantitatively explored the factors associated with teenage pregnancy.
## Expected output
The overall goal of this project analytics is to provide datasets about the factors why teenager in Nigeria are engaging in early pregnancy. In order to determine what was the possible solutions of government about early pregnancy.
